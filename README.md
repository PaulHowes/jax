# Jax

JSON parser and generator for C++

# Building

Jax is distributed only as a header. There is nothing to compile in this repository other than
tests which also illustrate how to use Jax.

## Dependencies

* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) 2.8.12 or newer
* C compiler. The following have been tested:
  * [llvm](http://llvm.org) 3.4 or newer
  * [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org) 4.8.3 or newer
  * [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com)

## Instructions

I highly recommend building outside of the source tree so that build products do not pollute the
repository. The simplest way to accomplish this is to create a sub-directory named "build" as
follows:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ make test
